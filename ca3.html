<p>In 1975, after working in Singapore, Tommy and Hal Meadow returned to the US with what they say were three local brown-ticked cats.  These three cats, a pair of male and female kittens form the same litter and another oung frmale, were the foundationsed to establish the Shigapura.  The breed takes its name form the Mala name for Singapore.  In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the profile of the Singapura(with the exception of the tail)in the local Society ofr the Prevention of Cruely to Animals.
